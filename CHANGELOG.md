## [Unreleased]

### Major Refactoring (Breaking Changes)
- **BREAKING**: Decomposed monolithic `cmd/files.go` (1193 LOC) into focused files â‰¤200 LOC each:
  - `cmd/items/items_root.go` - Command registration and flag setup
  - `cmd/items/items_helpers.go` - Shared utility functions
  - `cmd/items/items_meta.go` - List, stat, search, versions, thumbnails, preview commands
  - `cmd/items/items_upload.go` - Upload, mkdir, and upload management commands  
  - `cmd/items/items_download.go` - Download and deprecated list commands
  - `cmd/items/items_manage.go` - File operations (rm, mv, rename, copy)
  - `cmd/items/items_permissions.go` - Sharing and permissions management
- **BREAKING**: Removed all deprecated session helper functions in favor of Manager pattern:
  - Removed `GetConfigDir()`, `GetSessionFilePath()`, `Save()`, `Load()`, `Delete()` global functions
  - All session operations now use `session.Manager` with configurable directory support
  - Updated auth session handling to use Manager pattern consistently
- **BREAKING**: Commands moved from `onedrive-client files <subcommand>` to `onedrive-client items <subcommand>`
- **BREAKING**: No backwards compatibility provided for command structure or session functions
- Added centralized pagination flags helper in `internal/ui/pagingflags.go`
  - Eliminates duplication across commands requiring pagination
  - Standardizes `--top`, `--all`, and `--next` flag handling
- Updated `cmd/drives.go` to use centralized pagination helper

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Enhanced session management with proper locking and error handling
- Improved code organization with logical separation of concerns
- Better maintainability with focused, single-responsibility files

### Developer Experience
- Eliminated 1000+ line files for easier development and review
- Clear separation between command definitions and business logic
- Standardized error handling patterns across command files

### Changed
- **Major Architectural Refactor**: Overhauled the core SDK and application architecture to improve robustness, maintainability, and testability.
  - **Stateful SDK Client**: Replaced the stateless `pkg/onedrive` function collection with a new stateful `onedrive.Client`. This client now manages the HTTP client and token lifecycle internally.
  - **Transparent Token Refresh & Persistence**: The `onedrive.Client` now handles `401 Unauthorized` errors by automatically refreshing the access token and retrying the request. It uses a callback mechanism (`onNewToken`) to allow the application layer to persist the new token, decoupling the SDK from the storage implementation.
  - **Clean API Abstraction**: The `internal/app.SDK` interface is now directly implemented by `*onedrive.Client`, removing the previous `OneDriveSDK` wrapper and simplifying the application structure.
  - **Code Reorganization**: Migrated all API-related logic into `pkg/onedrive/client.go` and separated authentication flows into `pkg/onedrive/auth.go`. The obsolete `pkg/onedrive/onedrive.go` file has been removed.
- **Error Handling**: Added new sentinel `ErrInternal` in SDK and replaced the last anonymous internal error with it. Every error path in public SDK now returns a typed sentinel that can be detected with `errors.Is`.
- **CLI Command Reorganization**: Replaced the top-level `files`, `delta`, and `shared` commands with a single consolidated `items` command.  Delta tracking is now invoked as `items delta` and shared content as `items shared list`.  All former `files ...` subcommands are unchanged but are now invoked as `items ...`.
- **The upload code now uses the new `session.Manager` API instead of deprecated global helper functions, paving the way for thread-safe session handling and easier future locking.**

### Added

- **BREAKING**: Fixed path handling to use proper remote path utilities instead of `filepath.Join` for URL paths.
- Improved thread safety by ensuring token refresh callback uses configuration mutex properly.
- The underlying SDK now uses path-based addressing to look up items in OneDrive, allowing access to any file/folder, not just those in the root.
- Refactored core application to use an SDK interface for better testability.
- Switched to using `log` for user-facing success/error messages.
- Large file uploads now use a session-based approach instead of a single request.
- Renamed `LiveSDK` to `OneDriveSDK` for better clarity.
- Refactored test suite to use a shared `test_helpers_test.go` to avoid duplicated code and fix the build.
- **Overhauled Authentication Flow**: Replaced the previous blocking Device Code Flow with a non-blocking, stateful, and more user-friendly process.
  - `auth login` now starts the flow and exits immediately, allowing the user to continue working.
  - Any subsequent command (`files list`, `auth status`, etc.) will automatically attempt to complete the pending login.
  - The CLI now clearly reports its state: `Logged In`, `Logged Out`, or `Login Pending`.
  - Added file-locking to the authentication session file (`auth_session.json`) to prevent race conditions.
  - The `auth whoami` command was removed and its functionality merged into `auth status` for a cleaner interface.
- The local configuration file path can now be overridden with the `ONEDRIVE_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable for easier testing.
- Session management now uses proper dependency injection instead of global variable overrides for testing.
- Enhanced `DownloadFile` function to properly handle Microsoft Graph API's 302 redirect response pattern for download requests.
- Improved error handling in E2E tests to be more resilient to different error message formats.
- Updated E2E test directory creation logic to ensure proper hierarchy setup.
- **Testing**: E2E test suite is now part of the default `go test ./...` run. The `//go:build e2e` build tags were removed and helper functions now gracefully skip tests when `config.json` is not present.
- **Testing Robustness**: E2E helpers and tests now rely on typed sentinel errors (`onedrive.ErrResourceNotFound`, `onedrive.ErrInvalidRequest`, â€¦) instead of fragile string matching.

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed fundamental URL construction bug in `BuildPathURL()` function that was generating malformed URLs with double colons (`::`) instead of single colons (`:`).
- **Critical**: Fixed Microsoft Graph API endpoint URLs for file operations to match correct format:
  - Upload endpoints: `/me/drive/root:/path/to/file:/content`
  - Download endpoints: `/me/drive/root:/path/to/file:/content`
  - Create folder endpoints: `/me/drive/root:/parent-path:/children`
- **Critical**: Fixed `CreateFolder()` function URL construction to use proper path-based addressing.
- **Critical**: Fixed directory listing functionality in `GetDriveItemChildrenByPath` function by correcting URL construction to append `:/children` for non-root paths instead of `/children`.
- **Critical**: Fixed download functionality by implementing proper Microsoft Graph API redirect handling and fallback download methods using item metadata.
- **Critical**: Fixed error handling in E2E tests to properly recognize both "itemNotFound" and "resource not found" error formats from the SDK.
- **Critical**: Fixed E2E test directory creation by ensuring both root test directory and specific test directories are created properly.
- **Critical**: Standardized error handling patterns across all commands for consistency and testability.
- **Critical**: Fixed race conditions in session management by removing global variable patterns.
- **Critical**: Fixed path handling bugs where `filepath.Join` was incorrectly used for remote URL paths.
- **Critical**: Fixed thread safety issues in token refresh callbacks.
- **Critical**: Fixed E2E test compilation errors by removing tests for non-existent SDK functions (`DeleteDriveItem`, `MoveDriveItem`, `RenameDriveItem`)
- **Critical**: Resolved build failures in E2E test suite that were preventing proper test execution
- **E2E Tests**: Resolved all known limitations in E2E test suite - all tests now pass with 100% success rate.
- **E2E Tests**: Fixed hash comparison logic in download tests to compare local files directly instead of attempting redundant downloads.
- **E2E Tests**: Improved test isolation and reliability by ensuring proper directory structure creation before running tests.
- Resolved persistent build and test failures caused by Go module inconsistencies. This required manual adjustments to `go.mod` and repeated `go mod tidy` commands to correctly vendor a new dependency (`progressbar`).
- The build process was fixed by removing duplicated test helper code.
- Authentication command error handling to use RunE instead of log.Fatalf for better testability.
- Session directory creation in file locking operations to prevent "no such file or directory" errors.
- Test helper function signatures and session file path construction in authentication tests.
- Improved test output capture to properly handle log output without global state mutation.
- Improved chunked upload test logic to handle SDK limitations with final chunk responses
- **Critical Auth Fix**: Fixed a bug that prevented automatic token refreshes. The application was failing to set the token's `Expiry` time, causing the OAuth2 library to treat the token as if it never expired, which prevented the refresh mechanism from ever triggering.
- **OAuth Robustness**: Implemented automatic, transparent token refresh. If an API call fails with a 401 Unauthorized error, the client now automatically uses the refresh token to get a new access token and retries the original request.
- **Atomic Config Writes**: Configuration and token writes are now atomic (write to temp file + rename) to prevent corruption if the application is interrupted.
- **Thread Safety**: Fixed a potential deadlock in the configuration saving mechanism.
- Removed duplicate `persistingTokenSource` implementation from `internal/app`; the single authoritative implementation now lives in the SDK (`pkg/onedrive`).
- Session manager now respects the `ONEDRIVE_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable ensuring test isolation and consistent session file locations.

### Removed
- Removed the old `drives` command, which was a temporary implementation for listing root items. Its functionality is now part of `files list`.
- Removed the old, interactive authentication flow that required pasting a URL back into the terminal.
- **BREAKING**: Removed global variable patterns in session management in favor of proper dependency injection.
- Removed problematic E2E tests for non-existent SDK functionality to fix compilation errors.
- Removed internal token refresh logic from the SDK in favor of a new, more robust persistence layer within the application that correctly uses the `golang.org/x/oauth2` library's features.

### Security
- Enhanced session file locking to prevent race conditions in concurrent CLI invocations.
- Improved error message handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in logs.
- Session and authentication state files are now written with `0600` permissions instead of `0644`, preventing other local users from reading sensitive data.
- Upload session files are now protected by advisory file locks to avoid corruption when multiple CLI instances access the same session concurrently.

### Changed
- Refactored SDK into an interface for testability.

### Fixed
- Test suite now uses a mock SDK to avoid live network calls.
- Build process is now more reliable.

### Security
- Session and authentication state files are now written with `0600` permissions instead of `0644`, preventing other local users from reading sensitive data.
- Upload session files are now protected by advisory file locks to avoid corruption when multiple CLI instances access the same session concurrently.
