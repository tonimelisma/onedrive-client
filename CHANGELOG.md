## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New `files mkdir <path>` command to create a directory.
- New `files upload <local-file> [remote-path]` command to upload files.
- New `files download <remote-path> [local-path]` command to download files.
- Added an SDK interface abstraction to allow for mock-based testing of commands.
- New `files` command to serve as the main entrypoint for file operations.
- New `files list [path]` command to list contents of a directory. Defaults to root if no path is provided.
- New `files stat <path>` command to view detailed metadata for a specific file or folder.
- Resumable large file uploads with progress bar and interrupt handling.

### Changed
- The underlying SDK now uses path-based addressing to look up items in OneDrive, allowing access to any file/folder, not just those in the root.
- Refactored core application to use an SDK interface for better testability.
- Switched to using `log` for user-facing success/error messages.
- Large file uploads now use a session-based approach instead of a single request.
- Renamed `LiveSDK` to `OneDriveSDK` for better clarity.

### Removed
- Removed the old `drives` command, which was a temporary implementation for listing root items. Its functionality is now part of `files list`.

### Fixed
- Resolved persistent build and test failures caused by Go module inconsistencies. This required manual adjustments to `go.mod` and repeated `go mod tidy` commands to correctly vendor a new dependency (`progressbar`).

## [0.1.0] - 2024-05-20

### Added
- Initial release with basic `files list` and `files stat` commands.
- OAuth2 authentication flow.
- Configuration file management for storing tokens.
