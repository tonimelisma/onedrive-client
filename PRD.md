# Product Requirements Document: onedrive-client (v2)

## 1. Overview and Project Aims

### 1.1. Project Aim

The primary goal of the `onedrive-client` project is to create a powerful, fast, and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Microsoft OneDrive. The long-term vision is to build a full-fledged, bi-directional sync client. The immediate focus is on providing a robust set of command-line primitives for manual file management, including resilient large file transfers.

This tool serves users who prefer to work in a terminal environment, enabling them to manage their OneDrive files and folders without needing a graphical user interface.

### 1.2. Target Audience

*   Developers, System Administrators, and Power Users.
*   Users who need to script interactions with their OneDrive storage.
*   Users who want a lightweight, non-GUI alternative for managing their cloud files, especially for large file transfers.

## 2. Technical Implementation Notes

The client is written in Go and uses the [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/) library for its command-line interface.

All interactions with the Microsoft Graph API are handled by an integrated **SDK package** located at `pkg/onedrive`. This package is responsible for authentication, request signing, and API call logic. The main application (`cmd/` and `internal/`) focuses on user interaction, command parsing, and orchestrating calls to this SDK.

**Future Goal:** For better reusability, the SDK in `pkg/onedrive` will be extracted into its own version-controlled Git repository. This will allow other applications to use the Go SDK for OneDrive without depending on the `onedrive-client` CLI application itself.

### Technical Implementation Details
#### 2025-06-29 OAuth Hardening

*   **[x] User Story 5.5:** I want proper test cleanup and safety measures to protect user data.
    *   **Implementation:** Tests use isolated directories and include cleanup procedures
*   **[x] User Story 5.6:** I want API bug detection through real endpoint testing.
    *   **Achievement:** Discovered and fixed critical URL construction bugs in Microsoft Graph API calls

**Setup Process:**
1. Authenticate with CLI: `./onedrive-client auth login`
2. Copy config to project: `cp ~/.config/onedrive-client/config.json ./config.json`
3. Run E2E tests: `go test -tags=e2e -v ./e2e/...`

- **Current E2E Tests:** Test SDK functionality directly (`helper.App.SDK.UploadFile()`)
- **Future CLI E2E Tests:** Test actual CLI commands (`./onedrive-client files upload test.txt /remote/`)

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create CLI test harness using `exec.Command()` 
2. Implement output parsing and validation utilities
3. Add CLI-specific test scenarios covering all commands
4. Integrate with existing E2E test infrastructure for authentication
5. Maintain both SDK and CLI test suites for comprehensive coverage
